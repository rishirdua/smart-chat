Want to take pic's all the time
battery life, smartmedia card is way too small
Fuji using an un-essential 5V AC adapter, available only from them! Sounds fishy...
Small memory card and poor zoom mode
Slow download time &amp;amp; somewhat degredation in photos in poorly lit rooms
no lens cover
None
Strictly JPEG file format
poor picture quality
No optical zoom. SM card too small.
See above :)
slow transfer time
Slow onboard camera - computer transfer, picture shown in LCD screen prior to shot is a bit brighter than the final image, no lense cover
Useless bundled software, no DC cord included, zoom is kinda weird, not feature laden
Costly power adapter!
Need extra tool for fast image transfer
bad zoom
Eats Batteries
Sometimes light spots on photos
Smartmedia storage, LCD drains batteries quickly, very little zoom.

price
As any flexible camera, that is with many controls and posibilities, NOT for newcomers, not for point and shooters. Instruction manual fairly good, Nikon has used video on halide cameras to help learn many controls; may be Fuji should do same.

Slow startup time, sharpness issue
camera takes a long time to shoot, takes a long time to delete photos individually
waits about 5 seconds to take picture so if it's moving you might miss it!
Unreliable
Build quality low, divided responsibility for warranty issues
Takes a little too long to take picture.  
Quality of long range shots is not great.
